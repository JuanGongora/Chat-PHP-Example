# Chat-PHP-Example
An example chat based system built with vanilla PHP and JavaScript.

This is lightweight, boilerplate code, and can be developed on quite easily.

In order to test this application out, you need to have an AMP stack set up in your local machine:

If you are using Windows or Linux I recommend [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).

If you are on a Mac OS then I recommend [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) (the free version works just fine for this).

After you have set your AMP stack up, make sure to import the [chat.sql](chat.sql) database (using [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) or the like, which comes pre-packaged with some AMP stacks).

Then set your access parameters in [Config.php](Config.php).
