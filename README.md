# Chat-PHP-Example
An example chat based system built with vanilla PHP and JavaScript.

In order to test this application out, you need to have an AMP stack set up in your local machine:

If you are using Windows or Linux I recommend [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)

If you are on a Mac OS then I recommend [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) (the free version works just fine for this)

After you have set your AMP stack up, make sure to import the [chat.sql](Chat-PHP-Example/chat.sql) database (using [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) or the like, which comes pre-packaged with some AMP stacks).

Then set your access parameters in [Config.php](Chat-PHP-Example/Config.php).

If you'd like to see an example of this chat system here is a [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yaoS9s-yC710Hradz0y-fhwnj2qMvgNE/view?usp=sharing).
